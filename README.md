Got you.
Here’s a **clean, professional, portfolio-ready main README** for your repo that will host **multiple small games**, including *Cosmic Drift* and any future ones you build.

You can copy this straight into `README.md` at the root of your repo.

# ✅ **MAIN README FOR YOUR GAME COLLECTION REPO**

# 🎮 Web Game Collection – Interactive Experiments & Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small, polished web-based games built using **React**, **Vite**, and **React Three Fiber (R3F)**—alongside modern animation and rendering tools such as **GSAP**, **Framer Motion**, **Three.js shaders**, and **post-processing effects**.

These projects are meant to:
- showcase advanced **frontend engineering**
- demonstrate **3D rendering**, **gameplay logic**, and **interactive experiences**
- feature **performance-optimized WebGL scenes**
- act as standalone demos embedded on my **portfolio website**

Each game in this collection lives inside its own module and serves as a separate visual or gameplay experiment.  
This repository will expand over time as more games and interactive concepts are developed.

````

### **/src/games/**
Contains the source code for each individual game.  
Each game is modular, isolated, and can run independently.

### **/descriptions/**
Markdown files that describe each game:
- game concept  
- visuals & technical features  
- controls  
- tech used  
- development notes  

These files will be used on my portfolio to dynamically show information about each game.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This repo uses a modern frontend and WebGL setup:

- **React + Vite** – fast, lightweight, modern development workflow  
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** – declarative 3D & WebGL  
- **Three.js** – rendering, geometry, materials, shaders  
- **@react-three/drei** – helpers, cameras, controls, abstractions  
- **GSAP** – advanced animation & velocity curves  
- **Framer Motion** – high-quality UI animations  
- **Zustand** – global state management & game loops  
- **Postprocessing** – bloom, chromatic aberration, depth effects  

This stack allows each game to feel responsive, smooth, cinematic, and optimized.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo exists to:

- Build a reusable **hub for multiple interactive experiments**
- Showcase **gameplay engineering** and **real-time graphics**
- Experiment with **physics**, **procedural generation**, **particles**, and **custom shaders**
- Serve as a backend for loading games on my **portfolio site**

Every game focuses on one or more engineering concepts:
- rendering & post-processing  
- movement systems  
- infinite runners  
- physics simulations  
- UI/UX transitions  
- reactive gameplay architecture

## 🧩 Current Games

### **1. Cosmic Drift (In Development)**
A neon, high-speed **infinite wormhole runner** where players dodge obstacles, activate power-ups, and survive as long as possible.  
Features include:
- procedural obstacle spawning  
- speed-based difficulty scaling  
- glow + chromatic aberration  
- GSAP-driven effects  
- R3F player controller  
- sleek sci-fi HUD  

Full description available in:  
`/descriptions/cosmic-drift.md`

## 🎮 Upcoming Games

- **Cybergrid Arena** – neon arcade shooter (3D variant)  
- **Orbital Physics Sandbox** – interactive physics playground  
- **Circuit Runner** – SVG + 2D neon runner  
- More experimental concepts coming soon…

Each will include its own folder + detailed description file.

# 👍 Next Step  
Now that the **main README is done**, tell me:

### **Do you want me to generate the `/descriptions/cosmic-drift.md` file next — the standalone description for the game?**

Just say **“yes generate it”** and I’ll write the full description file.
```
